            <h2>To the speakers at Trondheim Developer Conference 2018</h2>
            <p>Useful information for you as a speaker at TDC 2018. If there is something else you want to know, please contact us!</p>

            <p>Trondheim Developer Conference is fast approaching. This is the seventh annual TDC.
                We want the participants to leave the conference with inspiration and a feeling that this day was really worth their while.
                We and the hopefully 700 participants are looking forward to your talks!</p>

            <h5>Tickets</h5>
            <p>You do not have to buy tickets. You will get your badge either at the <a href="#speakersdinner">speakers’ dinner</a>
                or at registration when the conference starts. Registration opens at 08.00.</p>

            <h5>Conference program, your bio, picture and abstract</h5>
            <p>The main themes for this years conference is languages and tools. But there will be a variety of other topics as well.
                These topics are mixed into five different tracks, to balance the pressure on the different rooms at the conference venue.</p>
            <p>TDC is a conference for the local development community and about half of the talks will be held in Norwegian and the rest in English.
                You may update the description of your talk, and your picture, at any time at <a href="https://submitit.trondheimdc.no">submitit.trondheimdc.no</a>!</p>

            <p>Sessions have a timespan of 30 minutes for CFPs and 45 minutes for invited "deep dive" speakers and it’s not possible to extend the time.
                Since the sessions are so short we discourage live coding.
                The keynote and the main lectures have 50 minutes available.
                There will be 9 breaks including lunch. During the breaks it is possible for attendees to mingle and
                talk to the over 20 different companies, startups and communities at stands in the hall outside the
                conference rooms. We encourage you to be available for questions in the hall area during the breaks as well.</p>

            <p>The program will be available online shortly at <a href="https://2018.trondheimdc.no/program">2018.trondheimdc.no/program</a>.
                We will notify you when it is available.
                When it is ready, please take a minute to review and verify that your bio and abstract are correct and up to date.</p>

            <h5><a name="speakersdinner">Speakers’ dinner</a></h5>

            <p>All speakers are invited to a lovely dinner the evening before the conference.
                The dinner starts at 19.00 and is held at the conference hotel in Astrum Skybar.</p>

          <!--  <p>If you haven’t already registered for the speaker’s dinner during your CFP or speaker registration form,
                please send an email to connect@trondheimdc.no within Friday, October 27th to register for the dinner.
                Please note in the email if you have allergies and/or preference for vegetarian meals, so the kitchen
                could take this into account when preparing the dinner.</p>-->

            <h5>Party</h5>
            <p>There will be a party at the end of the conference held at the conference hotel. We hope that all speakers join us at the party.
                There will be a light meal and a drink coupon for each attendee.</p>

            <h5>Equipment</h5>

            <p>
                With many talks across five tracks the need for a well-composed schedule is paramount.
                If you wish, our dedicated technical crew can preload your slides into the conference system to ensure
                that everything runs as smooth as possible. Or you can show up in the break before your slot to test everything.
                The technician will be available to help.

            <p>To achieve this we need you to submit your talk to us by the 19. of October at 12:00 CET.
            Please send your complete talk to <a href="mailto:connect@trondheimdc.no?subject=TDC2018 talk">connect@trondheimdc.no</a> with the subject “TDC2018 Talk”.</p>

            <p>Each conference room is equipped with a widescreen projector supporting resolutions up to 1920x1080 and aspect ratio 16:9.
                You will be provided with a clicker and a microphone for your talk. Connectors for HDMI, DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort are available.</p>

            <p>If your laptop requires a special video adapter, you must remember to bring your own.
                The rooms have great audio systems for you to use through a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a wired internet connection.</p>
            <p>If you wish to verify that your computer/code demo works with the AV-equipment at the venue, please do so on Sunday evening between 4pm and 8pm local time.</p>

            <h5>Network</h5>
            <p>Wired Internet access will be available on stage, and wireless access is provided throughout the conference hotel.</p>

            <h5>Session recordings</h5>
            <p>All of our sessions will be recorded, and we hope you will give us permission to post the video on our Vimeo page: https://vimeo.com/trondheimdc.
                We plan to upload videos as soon as they are ready. If you would like to review the video or have any other requirements that will prevent posting of the video, please state so when you receive your conference badge.</p>

            <h5>Speakers’ lounge</h5>
            <p>There will be a speakers’ lounge where you can prepare before your talk and unwind after it.
                It will be open only for speakers and certified personnel.</p>
