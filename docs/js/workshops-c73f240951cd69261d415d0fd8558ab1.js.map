Sikkerhetstester må ikke tilføre en stor arbeidsbyrde, gi relevant informasjon raske forbedringer i applikasjonsmiljøet. For å få til dette, må applikasjonssikkerhet være en integrert del av måten vi tenker på utvikling og drift. \\n\\nFor å få til dette har vi, og mange andre, styrende dokumenter som setter krav til og beskriver utviklingsprossen - men dette i seg selv er ikke nok til å skape en god kultur for etterlevelse. For å gjøre vår guideline for sikker utvikling til en levende prosess som alle forsøker å etterleve, har vi satset stort på å integrere automatiserte tester i utviklingen, i tillegg til et høyt fokus på trusselmodellering og sikkerhetsbevissthet. I denne presentasjonen gir vi en introduksjon til vår tilnærming - og vil avslutte med noen tanker om fallgruver og suksessfaktorer for innføring av systematisk bruk av automatisert testing i sikkerhetssammenheng.

How do you arrive at good abstractions?\\n\\nMost programmers try to 'invent' abstractions from scratch. This is an elusive goal. It requires a level of foresight rarely available. What if, instead, you could use existing, universal abstractions?\\n\\nFor decades, programmers have dreamt of being able to assemble software from building blocks, like Lego bricks. In order to do this, such building blocks must be composable, like Lego bricks. What makes an abstraction composable? It turns out that lambda calculus, abstract algebra, and category theory can teach us about composability and other fundamental abstractions of programming. Furthermore, it turns out that some of the most important design patterns in the Gang of Four book are special cases of such universal abstractions.\\n\\nFraming programming abstractions in mathematical terms has some advantages, one of which is that we get objective laws that we can use to test our assumptions. You can, for example, use such laws to determine whether an abstraction is composable – even in object-oriented programming!\\n\\nIn this workshop, you'll learn some objective criteria to determine whether a design is composable, and when various design patterns apply. No special background in mathematics is required.\\n\\nThe workshop will include a combination of lecture and exercises, including hands-on programming exercises.\\n\\nSuccessful participation in the workshop should enable you to use universal abstractions in your source code.
